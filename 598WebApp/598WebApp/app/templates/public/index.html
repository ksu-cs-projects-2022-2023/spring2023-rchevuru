            <p> Hello! My name is Rana Chevuru, and this is my cool litle project. As you can see there are diffrent links on top on the navigation bar.
            Each of those tabs will route you to diffrent websites, and the Project is the the tab I worked on for the majority of the semster.
            To use this tool effectively I recommend on opening project and country tables tabs together since the input for partners has countries three word abbreviations instead the name.
            To see what the products being traded I recommend heading for to country info to see that, otherwise project should show trade with other nations. </p>
            <p>Project allows users to select input to then diplay a graph based on their selection. </p>
            <p>Country Table contians all 250 diffrent countries with their respected info. </p>
            <p> Requst change allows the user send any remarks they whish a country needs to be updated</p>
            <p> Finally, get country info allows the user to view the diffrent countries from the given dataset</p>
